## Getting Started

First get the required software, as I have windows 10 on my pc I'm only adding links to this version of various software. 

### Prerequisites

This project requires

   * Jupyter notebook
   * iPython via Anaconda and other python packages like mathplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn, scipy;  
   * cmder 
   * Github account
    
Anaconda has python, ipython, jupyter notebook and a large number of common python packages required in Data Analysis. 

   1. Get anaconda 3.7 version for windows [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
   2. Get git 2.19.1 [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   3. Get cmder 1.3.6 [Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.3.6/cmder.zip) - Optional (cmder comes with git so you can drop option 2 above if you go with option 3).  
   4. Get github account - set up github account and create a repo [Github](https://github.com/)


### Installing

Install the above packages. Any problems google it. Update any packages; From cmder type... 

```
conda update â€“all 
git - version

```

## Repository structure

The gitignore file ignores the .git and .ipynb_checkpoints in the local folder. Python files are also ignored. A standard gitignore file was used. It can be found here [Python gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore) 

* img - various images used within the report; 
* .gitignore - gitignore file taken from [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore)
* Anscombe.csv dataset taken from [Anscombe](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs102/datasets/Anscombe.csv)
* LICENSE - Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004
* README.md - this readme
* anscombe.ipynb - The main body of the assignment
* anscombe1973.pdf - F. Anscombe's original article from 1973


## Jupyter 

The main body of work is in the jupyter notebook *anscombe.ipynb*. 


### Running a Jupyter notebook


#### Start jupyter notebook

There are two ways to start jupyter notebook. 

   1. Via the Anaconda App 
   2. Via the command line on cmder. 

I will describe the cmder approach.


Open cmder in your home directory or from a folder within the home directory. Jupyter notebook will only be able to access this folder and any sub folders for example... 
```
C:\Users\Username\Desktop\Workfolder\
```

   * Create a repo on github [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Osheah/foda-anscombe)
   * Clone the repo on github by clicking the green clone or download link
    
Go to cmder and enter for example  ...

```
git clone https://github.com/Osheah/foda-anscombe.git
git init
```
Open jupyter notebook using the command...

```
jupyter notebook

```
A browser should open linking the current directory in cmder to an jupyter version of windows explorer. Jupyter notebook will open at its home page http://localhost:8888/tree


### create a jupyter notebook

Navigate to your cloned folder from within the Jupyter notebook home. On the right click the 'new' button and select python 3. A new jupyter notebook for python 3 will open with the default title *untitled*. Click on the name *untitled* and rename it e.g. project.ipynb. Details on how to create cells in jupyter notebook can be found here [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#basic-workflow). Save any work (although it is usually saved automatically). 

### ending a jupyter notebook session

Save any unsaved jupyter notebooks. Close jupyter notebook windows in your browser. Go to cmder and enter **control + c** i.e. the control key and the c key pressed at the same time. This shuts the ipython kernal that jupyter uses. Upload your notebook to github via the commands below; Make sure that you are in the directory that git is initialised in e.g. C:\Users\Username\Desktop\Workfolder\project\

```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "add a relivent commit message"
git push
```

### opening a jupyter notebook

Jupyter notebooks have the extension ipynb. When you find a notebook that you want to look at or edit, dont click on it; Instead right click and save it to your local pc. Then open jupyter notebook via the cmder commandline and navigate to the notebook. NB; **before opening the notebook make sure the notebook is saved in a sub directory of the cmder path**. Jupyter notebooks cannot access any files that are not within the path when the kernal is called.
